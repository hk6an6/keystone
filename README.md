DSL to model test cases. The model compiles into javascript to be run by TestComplete or TestExecute. Automate all your UI/end-user tests!

Getting started:

1. Install eclipse DSL with xtext v2.6 from https://www.eclipse.org/Xtext/download.html
2. Do a git clone
3. Set the resulting folder as your eclipse workspace
4. Create a "src-gen" folder in eclipse
5. Run the MWF/xtext workflow on the Keystone.xtext file
6. Always go for TDD, that's what the tests project is for!
